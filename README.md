# polylith_archive
old old old code

This is a project from 2018.
I helped my Industrial Design Friend Riki make a giant MIDI controller.

I used two arduinos, copper tape, and a MIDI to USB Interface.

One Arduino read each group of five capacitive pads and sent a value for each group to the other Arduino over I2C, which received the values and was wired to a MIDI jack.

We used Ableton Live to run some synth loops with the different touch sliders on the Polylith assigned to different parameters of timbre.
